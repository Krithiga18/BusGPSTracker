Hi!
I am Krithiga Ravikumar,a UG Computer Science Engineering Student.

I, along with my team members created a webpage for tracking the live location of the college bus using google map APIs and python.

		The latitudes and longitudes of the bus routes were collected as a part of our data collection.

		SQLite has been used to create a database that stord the data and implements it with the API interface.

		HTML and CSS were used for creating and designing the front end.
